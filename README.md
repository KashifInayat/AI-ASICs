- Project/rtl directories contain the earlier form of designs of multiplier, CLA that use later modified in the DAC2020. 

- TensorProcessing4x4_OutputStationary is the earlier directories for new project I working. It is a complete 4x4TensorProcessingCore with efficient double buffer.

- CPAF-Gemmini is a project in which we performed the factoring of CPA on practical open soruce gemmini accelerator.
